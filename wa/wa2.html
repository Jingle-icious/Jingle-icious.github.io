            <h1>Hiya! My name is Evelyn Upchurch, a first-year CTD major at CU Boulder. </h1>
                <p> My pronouns are she/her, and I am a aspiring UI/UX designer and web-developer. My hopes for this course is to gain a better understanding than I already have of the basics of web-dev! </p>

            <h1>Hiya! My name is Evelyn Upchurch, a first-year CTD major at CU Boulder. </h1>
                <p> My pronouns are <em>she/her</em>, and I am a aspiring UI/UX designer and web-developer. I love anime, video games, cats, and skiing, 
                    and  I do a lot of digital art/drawing in an anime/cartoon style.
                    My hopes for this course is to gain a better understanding than I already have of the basics of web-dev! </p>

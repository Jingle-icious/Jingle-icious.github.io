        <a href="Evelyn_Upchurch_Looking_Side.png">Hiya! My name is Evelyn Upchurch, a first-year CTD major at CU Boulder. My pronouns are she/her, and I 
            am a aspiring UI/UX designer and web-developer. My hopes for this course is to gain a better understanding than I already have of the basics of web-dev! </a>

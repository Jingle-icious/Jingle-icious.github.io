        <h1 id="Anime_vs_Cartoons"> Anime vs. Cartoons </h1>
            <h2> One of the most important things for any animation-enthusiast to understand in the difference between anime and cartoons. So, here's some basic info on that difference! </h2>
                <h3>
                    Anime and cartoons both are really popular for entertaining people through different platforms but people are really confused between these two terms, so letâ€™s understand the meaning of both of these in their classic sense. <br>

                    <em>Anime</em> is also understood as a visual representation of real-world objects or things but it provides semi-realistic touch to these objects or characters. Characters of anime are generally equivalent to humans in respect of their design.<br>
                    
                    <em>Cartoons</em> can be defined as a visual representation of anything like a real-world character, objects and environments. These things are represented in an artistic form which is non-realistic in nature, one can easily identify these by their unusual designs.

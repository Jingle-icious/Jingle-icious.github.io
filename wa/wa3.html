        <h1 id="Anime_vs_Cartoons"> Anime vs. Cartoons </h1>
            <h2> One of the most important things for any animation-enthusiast to understand in the difference between anime and cartoons. So, here's some basic info on that difference! </h2>
                <h3>
                    Anime and cartoons both are really popular for entertaining people through different platforms but people are really confused between these two terms, so let’s understand the meaning of both of these in their classic sense. <br>

                    <em>Anime</em> is also understood as a visual representation of real-world objects or things but it provides semi-realistic touch to these objects or characters. Characters of anime are generally equivalent to humans in respect of their design.<br>
                    
                    <em>Cartoons</em> can be defined as a visual representation of anything like a real-world character, objects and environments. These things are represented in an artistic form which is non-realistic in nature, one can easily identify these by their unusual designs.

        <h2> As an avid action/adventure anime watcher myself, since it IS my favorite genre, I'll try to stick to only a top 10 and their descriptions. </h2>

            <h3> The <em>action</em> genre is a class of creative works characterized by more emphasis on exciting action sequences than on character development or story-telling. The genre encompasses action-adventure fiction, action films, action games and analogous media in other formats such as manga and anime. There are many sub-genres, including martial arts action, extreme sports action, car chases and vehicles, suspense action, and action comedy, with each focusing in more detail on its own type and flavour of action. It is usually possible to tell from the creative style of an action sequence, the genre of the entire creative works. For example, the style of a combat sequence will indicate whether the entire works is an action adventure, or martial arts.</h3>

                <h3> 
                    D.Gray-Man is my all time favorite anime, and honestly, I can't even begin to explain why. From the characters to the story to the music, everything about this show is just beautiful and it, in my eyes, is deserving of the #1 spot for action/adventure.<br>
                    
                    <br><em>Synopsis:</em><br>

                    <br>Losing a loved one is so painful that one may sometimes wish to be able to resurrect them—a weakness that the enigmatic Millennium Earl exploits. To make his mechanical weapons known as "Akuma," he uses the souls of the dead that are called back. Once a soul is placed in an Akuma, it is trapped forever, and the only way to save them is to exorcise them from their vessel using the Anti-Akuma weapon, "Innocence."

                    After spending three years as the disciple of General Cross, Allen Walker is sent to the Black Order—an organization comprised of those willing to fight Akuma and the Millennium Earl—to become an official Exorcist. With an arm as his Innocence and a cursed eye that can see the suffering souls within an Akuma, it's up to Allen and his fellow Exorcists to stop the Millennium Earl's ultimate plot: one that can lead to the destruction of the world.

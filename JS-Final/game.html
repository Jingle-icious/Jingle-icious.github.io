        <p>I'm what you'd call a "gamer" xD, so I decided that I wanted to make a game that would use JavaScript, but not be incredibly difficult. Therefore, while having a conversation with my parents about old-school arcade games, we ended up bring up games like Pong and Breakout, so I decided to reacreate those.
